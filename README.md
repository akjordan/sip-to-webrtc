SIP-WebRTC
================

This is a Rails application built on top of the Devise authentication framework. This application is a proof of concept that demonstrates how you can take incoming calls over SIP or WeRTC and forward them to a WebRTC client.

The application handles user managment and mainipulates Twilio APIs but does not handle any call media.

The app is in production at this URL: www.siptowebrtc.com
