    <h2>Twilio SIP Interface to WebRTC</h2>
    <p class="lead">Hello there, this is a sample application that demonstrates how you can push calls to a Twilio WebRTC softphone via SIP or PSTN. You can get started in four easy steps.</p>
    <h4>1. Create an account</h4>
    <p>Click on "Sign up" and enter your name, email, and company name. Twilio will automatically generate a SIP URL and a phone number for your account.</p>
    <h4>2. Give us a ring</h4>
    <p>Call the supplied phone number to make your soft phone ring!</p>
    <h4>3. Configure access to your SIP domain</h4>
    <p>Twilio authenticates requests to Twilio SIP domains with a username and/or a whitelisted IP. In order to send calls to Twilio, you must set up at least one of these. If you'd like to authenticate with a username, click "Create ACL", if you'd like to use an IP, click "Create IPACL".</p>
    <h4>4. Send us an INVITE</h4>
    <p>Once you've set up your SIP domain to let your traffic through, send us an INVITE from your favorite PBX or softphone. We like using X-Lite and Asterisk but any SIP client will do.</p>
